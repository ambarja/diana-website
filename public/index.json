For example, unlike common file-syncing tools, it‚Äôs easy to recreate an earlier state of an entire project directory and every file from a particular point in time.¬†This feature among others makes Git version-control a handy tool in support of many research workflows and the respective outputs:¬†documents, visualizations, dashboards, slides, analysis, code, software, etc.\nGit is one of the most popular, open-source, version-control applications; originally developed in 2005 to facilitate the evolution of the world‚Äôs most far reaching and successful¬†open-source coding project.¬†Linux is a world-wide collaborative project that spans multiple developers, project managers, natural languages, geographies, and time-zones.¬†While Git can handle large projects, it is extensible and can easily scale up or down to support a wide range of workflows.¬†Additionally, Git is not just for software and code files.¬†Essentially any file on a file system can be monitored with Git: MSWord, PDF files, images, datasets, etc.¬†There are many ways to share a Git repository and profile your work.¬†The term push refers to a convenient process of synchronizing a repo up to a remote social coding hub.¬†Additional features of a hub include issue tracking, collaboration, hosting documentation, and Kanban Method planning.¬†Conveniently, pushing a repo to GitHub means maintaining a seamless, two-location backup ‚Äì a push will simultaneously and efficiently synchronize the timeline and file versions. Meanwhile, at a repo editor‚Äôs discretion, any collaborator or interested party can be granted access to their GitHub repository.\nMany public instances of social-coding hubs operate on a freemium model.¬†At GitHub most users pay nothing.¬†It‚Äôs also possible to run a local instance of a coding hub.¬†For example, OIT offers a local instance of GitLab, delivering many of the same features while enabling permissions, authorization, and access Via Duke‚Äôs NetID.\nWhile social coding hubs are great tools for distributing files and managing project life-cycles, in and of themselves they do not sufficiently ensure long-term reproducible access to research data.¬†To do that simply synchronize version-control repositories with archival research data repositories.\nResearch Data Repositories Preserving the computational artifacts of formal academic works requires a repository focus that is complementary to version-control repositories and social-coding hubs.¬†Nonetheless, version control is not a requirement of a data repository where the goal is long-term preservation. Fortunately, many special-purpose data repositories exist.¬†Discipline-specific research repositories are sometimes associated with academic societies.¬†There also exist more generalized archival research repositories such as Zenodo.org.¬†Additionally, many research universities host institutional research data repositories.¬†Not surprisingly, such a research data repository exists at Duke where the Duke University Libraries promotes and cooperatively shepherds Duke‚Äôs Research Data Repository (RDR).\nUnlike social coding hubs, data repositories operate under different funding models and are motivated by different horizons.¬†Coding hubs like GitHub do not promise long-term retention, instead they focus on immediate distribution of version-control repos and ‚Ä¶","date":1645056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650561380,"objectID":"5647a39afc9e116472f6589582d86f86","permalink":"http://example.org/post/code-repository-vs-archival-repository-you-need-both/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/code-repository-vs-archival-repository-you-need-both/","section":"post","summary":"The imperatives for preserving research data are derived from expressly different motives than those driving version-control repositories.","tags":["repo","git"],"title":"Code Repository vs Archival Repository.
